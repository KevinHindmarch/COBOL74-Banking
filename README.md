# COBOL74-Banking-CardDemo
Amazon COBOL74 Translation Repository
# Overview
This repository contains a translated version of an original Amazon project (https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-mainframe-modernization-carddemo), converted into COBOL74 for testing and validation purposes. It serves as a technical exploration of legacy system compatibility, with a focus on how modern software concepts can be expressed within the constraints of historical programming languages.

# Purpose
The primary objective of this repository is to:

Evaluate the feasibility of porting modern logic into legacy COBOL74 environments.

Facilitate testing of COBOL74 compilers and runtime behavior.

Provide a reference implementation for educational or archival interest.

Support internal tooling and legacy infrastructure assessments.

About COBOL74
COBOL74 refers to the ANSI COBOL standard released in 1974, a widely adopted version during the height of COBOL’s use in enterprise environments. It lacks many of the features introduced in later standards (like COBOL85 or COBOL2002), making this translation both a technical challenge and an informative exercise.

# Disclaimer
This is not a production-ready implementation and should not be used for commercial or critical infrastructure. The repository is intended solely for experimental, testing, and research purposes.

Structure
src/ – Contains COBOL74 source files.

Getting Started
To run or test this code:
Clone Repo
Use a IDE or COBOL74-compatible compiler or emulator (e.g., OpenCOBOL/GnuCOBOL with legacy settings).
